_**01. Whats and why API?**_
1. Application Program Interface
        
        programA ==================> ProgramB   
        with out knowing Program A Code
   eg: Android Mediaplayer API, camera API.
2. Web API:
    commuication with the help of internet
    
3. Web API Protocol: 
    set of rules to communicate between devices.
    
    OSI model:
`        Application
        presentation
        session
        transport
        network
        datalink
        physical`
        
        digging in applicationlayer:
        Http mostly used.
        others are: FTP,pop
        
      ===> webservice: its a architecture.
    
    1.1 SOAP=Simple object access protocol:
          used xml to transmit info in form of object. 
    1.2 REST== alternative of soap.. transmit info.. 
    HTTP verbs used: GET, POST, Delete, update, patch
    
 4. Messaging format. xml/json.
    advan of json: human readable, easy to manipulate with js,python
    
 
 5. Rest constraints
 
 client
 
 server doesnot hold any state. no state is cached.. ..
 no storing authenticaion/authorization crediantial in server
 server
 
 advantage:
 
 1. can scale to million concurrent user. server can handle any request as no any session is stored in server.
 2. rest api less complex. as remove server side state logic.
 3. request contain extra parameter of info.. server never loses where each client is in applicaiton.
